# Built-a-Car-Racing-Game-Using-Amazon-Q-CLI-
As part of the “Build Games with Amazon Q CLI” campaign, I created a simple but addictive Car Racing Game using Pygame — with the help of Amazon Q CLI as my AI coding assistant.


🕹️ Game Summary
In this game, the player controls a red car that races along a three-lane road, dodging oncoming traffic. With smooth lane-switching, increasing difficulty, and high-score tracking, the game is both fun and challenging.

💡 How I Used Amazon Q CLI
Amazon Q CLI made game development more productive and enjoyable. I used it to:

Scaffold the game layout in Pygame using simple English prompts

Automatically create the player and enemy car logic

Add scoring, collision detection, and lane switching

Implement high score saving and retrieval

Get suggestions for smooth UI like rounded car edges and better lane graphics

🎨 Key Features
🚘 Three-lane racing with lane-switching

💥 Collision detection with game over screen

🏆 Score and high score tracking (saved locally)

📈 Dynamic difficulty — enemies get faster every 10 points

🎮 Smooth animations and responsive controls

🎧 Coming Soon
I'm currently working on adding:

Background music 🎶

Sound effects for crashes or level-ups 💥

Better visual effects like motion blur or explosions

💬 Final Thoughts
Thanks to Amazon Q CLI, I was able to build this project quickly while focusing more on creativity than code syntax. It’s a great tool for any aspiring game developer or hobbyist.

If you’re based in the Asia Pacific, Japan, or Greater China region, you can even redeem a T-shirt by participating!
